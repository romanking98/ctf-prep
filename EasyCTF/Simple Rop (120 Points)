Simple Rop (120 Points)

ROP stands for Return Orineted Programming which focuses on overwriting 4 bytes below the saved stack pointer (ebp) in order to call another function part of the program or libc. Here we are given the print_flag() function. We only need the address to this function. (Can be found using objdump or gdb)

After that,
echo $(python -c 'print "A"*76 + "<return address in LITTLE ENDIAN>"') | ./simple-rop

gives us the flag.
